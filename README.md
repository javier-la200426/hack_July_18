## 🗃️ PyScript template

This repo is a GitHub template to build a PyScript web application. The goal is
to give you a template that you can immediately utilize to create your own
PyScript website through Codespaces.

The repo contains the following:

* `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Configuration file used by Codespaces to
  configure Visual Studio Code settings, such as the enabling of additional
  extensions.
* `config.json`: the
  [PyScript configuration](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/configuration/)
  used by your application.
* `index.html`: the
  [HTML page](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/first-steps/)
  used to load your PyScript application.
* `main.py`: the [Python script](https://pyscript.net/) to run.
* `mini-coi.js`: a
  [utility](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/workers/#http-headers)
  to ensure all PyScript's features are available.
* `README.md`: this file (that you're reading right now).

## 🚀 Environment

This PyScript project contains everything you need so that you can immediately
open Codespaces, see it running, and deploy at any point.

Your development environment is all set for you to start.

* Visual Studio Code with the [Python plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) enabled.
* The [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin (so you can view your site).
* GitHub [copilot support](https://github.com/features/copilot) (if you have it enabled for your account).

  configure Visual Studio Code settings, such as the enabling of additional
  extensions.
* `config.json`: the
  [PyScript configuration](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/configuration/)
  used by your application.
* `index.html`: the
  [HTML page](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/first-steps/)
  used to load your PyScript application.
* `main.py`: the [Python script](https://pyscript.net/) to run.
* `mini-coi.js`: a
  [utility](https://docs.pyscript.net/2024.6.1/user-guide/workers/#http-headers)
  to ensure all PyScript's features are available.
* `README.md`: this file (that you're reading right now).
